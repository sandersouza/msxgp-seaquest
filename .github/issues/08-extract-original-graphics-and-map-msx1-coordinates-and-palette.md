## Goal
Extract source graphic shapes and lettering with provenance; map colors and display coordinates for SCREEN 2 while retaining canonical game coordinates.

## Target and fidelity contract
MSX1 with **64 KiB RAM and 16 KiB VRAM**, standard-speed Z80, TMS9918-family VDP and standard PSG; no expansions required. Atari 2600 is the behavioral authority; the Atari 800 port supports investigation and SeaQuestJs is a visual reference only. Initial ROM target is 32 KiB, subject to measured needs.

## Dependencies
- #7: Benchmark worst-case SCREEN 2 rendering and approve sprite strategy

## Definition of Ready
- [ ] Required dependency evidence is available; unresolved inputs are documented.
- [ ] Reference ROM revision/region, relevant source inputs and validation scenarios are identified.
- [ ] Scope and acceptance criteria below are understood.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Reproducible extraction outputs match reference shapes. Document clipping, bounds, palette and coordinate mapping. Visual adaptation does not change collision masks or movement; no substituted branding.
- [ ] Relevant checks pass and reproducible evidence is linked (ROM hash, tool versions, machine, settings, scenario and verdict where applicable).
- [ ] Documentation and delivery links are updated; unverified emulator/hardware claims remain explicit.

## Tracking
- Roadmap ID: SQ-08
- Type: Task (recorded here: the native issue type field did not persist through the GitHub API for this repository).
- Priority: P2 (normal backlog)
- Size: M
- Estimate: 9 hours, including implementation and validation; initial planning estimate, not a deadline.
- Project: [MSX Game Ports #7](https://github.com/users/sandersouza/projects/7)
- Initial status: Backlog
- Milestone: none (existing repository convention).

Original ROMs are local research inputs; do not publish them accidentally. This issue excludes work owned by dependent roadmap items.
